This was my first time at a large tech company and I had many more engineers to collaborate with and mentor.</p>
<p>I worked on a breadth of projects as lead engineer and I could make a consistent impact through the projects I worked on. Whether it was administrating our CMS, writing tools, writing api endpoints, crafting front-ends, terraforming infrastructure, mentoring engineers, giving talks, writing documentation, creating and delegating tickets, or fixing prod issues on-call, I did it all!</p>
<p>Rivian has been an interesting experience. I really got the chance to conduct interviews and work across the stack.

<p>I also decided to test out the experience of coliving and live in one of Starcity&#x27;s buildings. I really enjoyed the experience and I learned a lot about full stack work and leadership.</p>
<p>I eventually became the tech lead for the growth team and I spent a lot of my time documenting and delegating work to my team of engineers.

<p>I really got the chance to learn from engineers outside of our bubble in CT.

<p>Eventually moving onto making single page apps. These apps came in the form of fantasy sports games which were built with mostly Angular 1.x, eventually Angular 2 and React. I learned the necessary skills to make responsive and fun sports fantasy experiences.</p>
<p>I worked alongside many sports organization clients such as the NCAA, NFL, NHL, PGA and many more.

<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know two weeks maybe?&quot;
And I was off learning PHP. Alongside the web basics of HTML/CSS/JS but also Wordpress. I worked here from the beginning to the end of my time at Syracuse. I stayed through the summer to continue working that job. I learned much more at my job than I ever did at any classroom at Syracuse, so I decided to leave and continue to web development full time.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="tech"
